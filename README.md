Harbour.Space University | Apr 2024  
Lecturers: Anastasia Ianina and Michael Diskin  

## Overview
This repository contains my homework assignments for the course **"Deep Learning in Applications"**, conducted by **Anastasia Ianina** and **Michael Diskin** from **08 Apr to 26 Apr**.

The assignments include clearly defined tasks, goals, and achieved results across various deep learning applications in NLP and reinforcement learning.

## ðŸ“„ Lab 1: Bilingual Dictionary Induction and Unsupervised Embedding-Based MT
- **Task**: Implement an unsupervised bilingual dictionary induction system and embedding-based machine translation without parallel corpora, alignment, or deep neural networks.
- **Goal**: Investigate linear and orthogonal Procrustean mappings for embedding-based translation.
- **Result**: Successfully measured translation accuracy using precision metrics (top-1, top-5, and top-10).

## ðŸ“„ Lab 2: Neural Machine Translation in the Wild
- **Task**: Develop and compare various Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models, including RNN-based, attention mechanisms, Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), and fine-tuning pretrained models.
- **Goal**: Evaluate model performance regarding translation quality, computational complexity, and training time.
- **Result**: Determined that fine-tuning pretrained models provided the optimal balance among speed, complexity, and translation quality.

## ðŸ“„ Lab 3: Deep Q-Network Implementation	
- **Task**: Create a Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation with experience replay and target networks.
- **Goal**: Solve specified reinforcement learning environments (CartPole for debugging and Acrobot-v1 for main evaluation).
- **Result**: Implemented experience replay, performed TD-loss computations, and demonstrated successful training and improvement of reinforcement learning agents through detailed experimentation.
